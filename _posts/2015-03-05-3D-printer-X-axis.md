# 3D Printer X Axis
The X axis is now connected and working.  Using the steps per millimeter setting for the Y axis allowed me to make a movement of 100mm exactly.  This was exciting that I didn't have to sit and recalibrate.  

Next up is the extruder.  I have some ideas, it includes a lot of hot melt glue and may not work, but I'll give it a shot.  It this all work I'll begin on the next steps, a Mendel90 for the final form of this printer.
