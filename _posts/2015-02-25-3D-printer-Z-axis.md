# 3D Printer Z Axis
This weekend, with the help of my oldest son, I was able to get the Z axis built and implemented.  This was actually much easier than originally thought.  I have secured the top of the Z axis with some wood with properly sized holes drilled into it, levelled the smooth rods and then screwed and glued the top supports.  

My next step is the X axis, though I think this will be simple as well.  The next part that will be tough is the extruder.  I am considering ordering an extruder rather than cobbling one together, but that will take some challenge out of this design as well.  I'll have another update next week!
