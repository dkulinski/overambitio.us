# 3D Printer Extruder
Well the extruder was a lesson in frustration and just how much my time is worth.  My old son and I worked on a wooden version for hours and only were capable to get it to work marginally.  It wouldn't constantly extrude and often times would jam.  I was at my wits end with the failures until the final straw, yanking the filament out with pliers because it was just that suck.  I managed to crack the piece of wood I was using and at this point I looked up my alternatives.  I decided to have an extruder printed.  I had plenty of screws and bolts to make that work.  So I chose the following:

I used [3DHubs](http://3dhubs.com) to find a location near me and submit the job.  I managed to get find a hub just a couple of miles away and the operator was excellent.  I can't believe the level of service he provided.  That night, about 1:30am he provided me an update that he had finished my print!  He had the knowhow to correct the infil settings and product strong and exact parts.  I picked it up the next day and it fit together wonderfully well!  Thanks Ryan, this was awesome. His hub is located here: [Global Tech Now](https://www.3dhubs.com/denver/hubs/global-tech-now).  I highly recommend his services.

With all great news comes a problem, just the universe balancing things out.  While testing the exturder, sitting on my workbench, I managed to drop it and break a wire to the thermistor.  Now I have 2 on order, just in case I do this again.

Next step, figuring out the Z axis end stop and getting this ugly beast of a repstrap to print.  Once calibrated my first print will be replacement parts for the extruder.  This one piece has been a major hold up in the build and I don't want to be here again.  However, if it fails for some reason, I can go back to Ryan and get a replacement made quickly.
