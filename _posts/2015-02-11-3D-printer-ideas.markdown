# 3D Printer Ideas
In order to build a 3D printer, such as the Prusa i3, it is common to need printed parts.  In order to get around this you can start with a design that uses common parts from a home improvement store.  Such builds have been labeled RepStrap, a mash up of Reprap and bootstrap.  I am currently looking into designing my own RepStrap using as many parts from local home improvement stores as possible.  Early last year I start to purchase some parts that I can't find at Home Depot, mainly the stepper motors and the controller.  I have lumber to build the frame, rods and nylon bushings (simple rings) for the sliding mechanisms and threaded rod to move the Z axis.  I still need the following:

* Belts and pulleys to attach the carriages to the motors
* A hot end to melt the filament
* Filament
* An extruder

I am going to use the following ideas for some of these parts:

## Belts and Pulleys

### Nylon braided fishing wire
A more recent option I have seen is to use nylon braided fishing line of high strength to drive the axis. 

#### Pros
* Easily obtained at local sporting good stores
* Very strong and has been shown to keep tension

#### Cons
* Still need a spool to attach to the motors to give the line enough travel to move the plaform back and forth.

### Threaded Rod
Threaded rod can be used to drive all axis.  It is cheap and easy to work with.

#### Pros
* Cost effective
* Readily available
* Easy to mate to motors using clear plastic aquarium tubing

#### Cons
* Considerably slows print speeds

## Hot End
This will need to be purchased.  I talked with the designer of the J-head on the #reprap channel on Freenode and will be purchasing from his shop.

## Filament
So many choices and too far away to even contemplate it so far.

## Extruder
I could make a hobbed bolt and run a direct drive extruder, but at this point I believe it may be far easier to buy a premade extruder.
