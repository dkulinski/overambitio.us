###3D Printer
I have been collecting parts for a 3D printer wherever I can find them (junk printers, scrap lumber).  I have collected steppers, smooth rods, threaded rods and some wood. So now my next steps are to design the chassis and drive mechanisms.  I had this drawn on a sheet of paper but have misplaced that paper.  I am going to look at using a high strength fishing line to drive the X and Y axis.  

Going foward:

* Create an accurate drawing with measurements
* Acquire components to move X and Y axis
* Test electronics

Items to acquire:

* Hotend (J-Head most likely)
* High tensile strength nylon fishing line

When I am finished I hope to end up with something that looks similar to this: ![Wolfstrap]( {{ site.url }}/assets/Wolfstrap.jpg "Wolfstrap Printer")
