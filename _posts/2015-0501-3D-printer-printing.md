# 3D Printer
The printer is printing!  I was able to couple the Z axis with the 1/4" tubing and zip ties.  I have printed a couple 25mm cubes, a couple of whistles and a bracket for the fan that I designed in OpenSCAD!  I am now printing new couplers as the 1/4" tubing slips on higher accelerations.
